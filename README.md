# Generative-models
In roll_dice.py, I simulate rolling of two dice for n times and test it with n=100 and n=1000. for every case I run the simulation two times and then campare the result(sum of two dice) in a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) plot. The result was : every time we raise the number of dicing (in this case 100 to 1000) the final results become close to each other which means our simulation become better.  

In generative.py, They provided a text document for us. This text has a number of letters (lets consider in N). I simulate two text file with two type of distribution and create a text which contained N letters. I used zipf distribution and uniform distribution for simulating. then, I ranked the words frequencies for those three text files and campare the results in CDF plot.
(there are some pictures of output in this repository).
